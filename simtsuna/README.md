# SIMTSUNA (ARE)

## WEEK 3

During this week we've started working on the fluid simulation part of the project.
We will use a lattice Boltzmann method, modified to support free-surface fluid simulations.
For now, the simulation cannot handle collisions and free surfaces.

Fluid information is stored in a D3Q27 lattice.
